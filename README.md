# Chat App Wraper Bot

This Bot can copy messages from one group to another and monitor their content.

The Bot was created using Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries and runs on Raspberry-pi based on a Linux operation system.


- Reads messages from one group and copies them to another group with the senders' names.
- Can expand one group to another synchronizing content.
- Searches for inappropriate words, then sends a message with the details to pre-determined contact members notifying them.
